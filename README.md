# FarmerConsumer
Farmer Consumer Platform
This is farmer consumer platform where farmers can ditrectly interact with consumers. They post their product details and consumers can buy them. 
I have used HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT, EJS templates JQUERY, NODE JS AND MONGO DB.
index.js contains all node components(start).
index.html is home page.
When you open this try logging into email as masam@gmail.com and password as 3333. I have already inserted some data into that. So that you can easily see predicted sales.
The problem I am facing is when I have deployed on Heroku, I am able to open as farmer and do all operations but if I continue as customer it is showing some internal sever error. But if you run this in your local computer it works properly.
The live demo can be seen on https://farmertoconsumer.herokuapp.com
